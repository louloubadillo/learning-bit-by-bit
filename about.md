## Joaquín Badillo

I'm Joaquín, I love learning about mathematics and Computer Science. I am currently studying my first year of Computer Science at college and I am looking forward to solve any problem I can by implementing algorithms. I would like to develop graphic user interfaces for my programs so that it is clearer for others how to use it.
